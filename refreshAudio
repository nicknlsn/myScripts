# this script is a better solution to the ones described in the link above.
# this script will refresh the audio components for when i dock my mac
# and my headphones with an inline mic are not plugged in. when i plug
# my headphones in the inline mic won't be recognized, so this will 
# fix that. 
#
# note: if any audio is going when this script is run, the app running 
# that audio will likely need to be restarted to get audio from that 
# app to work again. this script can be improved to account for this 
# situation either by killing apps producing audio, or telling you to
# pause the audio before the script will proceed.

sudo killall coreaudiod
sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext
